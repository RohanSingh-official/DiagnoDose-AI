# 🧠 DiagnoDose AI

**AI-powered disease prediction, personalized dosage & diet recommendation platform secured with blockchain.**  
Built for ETHIndia under the Disease Prevention & Treatment Track.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**DiagnoDose AI** is a smart healthcare assistant that combines **machine learning**, **dietary science**, and **Ethereum blockchain** to make diagnosis, dosage, and diet safer, smarter, and more personalized. The platform empowers patients with predictive insights and ensures secure access to their medical history—without needing Python or advanced coding knowledge.

## 💡 Features

- 🔬 **Medical Diagnosis & Risk Prediction**  
  AI models analyze user vitals, symptoms, history, and lifestyle to predict disease probability.

- 💊 **Personalized Dosage Recommendation**  
  Custom dosage plans generated based on age, BMI, comorbidities, and health patterns.

- 🥗 **Dietary Plans Based on Condition**  
  Condition-specific and general diet suggestions, including calorie count and nutrient balance.

- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**  
  View diagnostic history, recommendations, and follow-up plans in one place.

- 🔐 **Blockchain-Backed Medical History**  
  Uses Ethereum (via Polygon) and smart contracts to securely store diagnosis data and ensure transparency.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **ML Models**: Ridge & Lasso regression for dosage prediction, trained externally  
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Polygon) for data integrity  
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask for authentication  
- **Data**: Mix of open-source datasets and synthetic health records for training

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Input**: Basic info (age, weight), vitals, symptoms, medical history  
2. **Prediction Engine**: AI models process inputs and assess disease risk  
3. **Dosage Calculation**: Personalized based on multiple health parameters  
4. **Diet Plan Generation**: Based on predicted or existing conditions  
5. **Blockchain Log**: All diagnostic events securely logged using smart contracts
